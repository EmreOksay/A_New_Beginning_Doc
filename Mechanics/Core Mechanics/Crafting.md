The player can craft items that will aid them on their journey. They will need to collect the materials they need. For this they can go out and gather wood or buy them from merchants and traders scattered in the tower and the town. Even though the player can craft simple items they will need the help of specific artisans to craft advanced stuff. For example they can craft arrows but for the bow itself they will need to go to blacksmith's weaponry section and then gather the materials needed for the bow.
