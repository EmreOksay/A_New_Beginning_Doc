Appeal is basically how good is your town. Depending on this parameter your town will either grow bigger or your subjects will eventually leave the town. This will also affect the townspeople's  mood if your appeal is high the people will be happier and the merchants will sell their items cheaper but if the appeal is low the people will treat you harshly and the merchants will sell much more expensive items. You can raise your appeal by repairing buildings or upgrading the merchants capacity. Every type of building you repair will give different appeal scores to the player the most appeal you can get is by repairing the decorative buildings
